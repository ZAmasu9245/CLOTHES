	ForbiddenJobsWithHeads is a most advanced feature.
	You can use it to do that jobs with uniforms ( police, medic, etc. ) keep their head when they take their uniform.
	In the following example :
	["Police"]={
		["male01"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_01.mdl",
		["male02"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_02.mdl",
		["male03"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_03.mdl",
		["male04"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_04.mdl",
		["male05"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_05.mdl",
		["male06"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_06.mdl",
		["male07"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_07.mdl",
		["male08"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_08.mdl",
		["male09"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_09.mdl",
		["female01"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_01.mdl", -- i don't find any for women sorry
		["female02"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_02.mdl",
		["female03"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_03.mdl",
		["female04"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_04.mdl",
		["female05"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_05.mdl",
		["female06"] = "models/taggart/police01/male_06.mdl"
	},

	Do not touch the ["male01"], ["male02"] etc. which are used by the script to work well.
	Change the "Police" by the name of the team.
	Change "models/taggart/police01/male_01.mdl" by the model with the head of the male_01 ( https://www.combinecontrol.com/chars/citizens_male_01.png )
	You can use this list https://www.combinecontrol.com/allowedmodels.php to know the male_number and the female_number
